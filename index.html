      <p class= 'card-text'> Music is my number 1 love. I started playing the drums when I was 8 and have played all my life in bands. I have recently started my solo EDM project under the name EMSKIII. I've been learning to produce for about a year and have been having a lot of fun making dance tracks! </p>
